Howdy y'all, this is my first blog post on my site. 

Here's a [link](/project1/) to my first project.

Just for convenience here's a link to [Google](https://www.google.com)

## Using Python with R

One of the neat things about markdown is that you can isolate code chunks in R and Python and have them run perfectly fine right next to each other.

For example, here I'll load in the classic iris dataset using R.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
iris <- iris
head(iris)
```

One of the coolest parts of this is that the R and python environments can talk to one another. For example, here we can use the imported iris dataset from above and use it in a python environment with ease.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
r.iris.head()

#We can also manipulate the dataset thanks to pandas
print(np.mean(r.iris["Sepal.Length"]))

#python lets us treat the dataframe like an array and index using indices
r.iris.loc[0:5,"Sepal.Length":"Petal.Length"] 
```

While there are certainly cases to use one language over the other, it's not like the two languages can't do similar things. Take for example plotting:


In R, ggplot can handle a lot of plotting needs.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)

iris %>% ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Example Plot", x = "Sepal Length", y = "Petal Length")

```

In python, matplotlib can do similar plots. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out why RStudio couldn't properly render the below python code but I promise that it can work on your computer if you copy the code.

{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(r.iris["Sepal.Length"], r.iris["Petal.Length"], color = "red", alpha = 0.5)
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length")
plt.ylabel("Petal Length")
plt.title("Example Plot 2: Electric Boogaloo")


At last, I leave you with this image. I hope it may haunt you as it haunts me.
